lunfardo
========

Originally, Lunfardo was a slang used by criminals and soon by other people of the lower and lower-middle classes in Argentina and Uruguay. Since the early 20th century, Lunfardo began to spread among all social strata and classes, either by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of tango.
