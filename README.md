In the mid XIX century, Buenos Aires was pullulating with immigrants, mainly Spanish and Italian. Many of them were impoverished and blended in with 
the already-poor locals: the descendents of aborigins and african slaves.

From the amalgam of the newcomers' languages with Argentina's 'castilian', emerged ther slang known as Lunfardo.

It was created by criminals, mainly to avoid being understood by prison guards.

It was disseminated thanks to 'tango' lyrics, a music which was born as suburban, marginal and was swiftly forbidden by the Church and higher classes. Tango was played and danced in ports, brothels, bars and prisons.

Nowadays, Lunfardo has blended into the castilian language and is part of its idiosincrasy.
