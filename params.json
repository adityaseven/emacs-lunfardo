Many of them were impoverished and blended in with \r\nthe already-poor locals: the descendents of aborigins and african slaves.\r\n\r\nFrom the amalgam of the newcomers' languages with Argentina's 'castilian', emerged ther slang known as Lunfardo.\r\n\r\nIt was created by criminals, mainly to avoid being understood by prison guards.\r\n\r\nIt was disseminated thanks to 'tango' lyrics, a music which was born as suburban, marginal and was swiftly forbidden by the Church and higher classes. Tango was played and danced in ports, brothels, bars and prisons.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Lunfardo has blended into the castilian language and is part of its idiosincrasy.\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unbalancedparentheses/lunfardo/master/images/lunfardo.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ready, steady, go!\r\n\r\nAssuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,\r\netc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you\r\ncan skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -L http://git.io/Rr3kZw | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### haven't you used emacs before?\r\n![](http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png)\r\n\r\n- Being productive with emacs [part I](http://web.psung.name/emacs/2009/part1.html) and [part II](http://web.psung.name/emacs/2009/part2.html)\r\n- [Emacs Mini Manual](https://tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor.html)\r\n- [emacs4developers](https://github.com/pierre-lecocq/emacs4developers)\r\n- [awesome emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs)\r\n- [Why Atom Canâ€™t Replace Vim](https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1)\r\n\r\n### basic elisp\r\n- [elisp guide](https://github.com/chrisdone/elisp-guide)\r\n- [When to use 'quote in Lisp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134887/when-to-use-quote-in-lisp)\r\n\r\n### if you come from the best modal editor\r\n- [Emacs as My <Leader>: Vim Survival Guide](https://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/emacs-as-my-leader-vim-survival-guide/)\r\n- [Vim in Emacs Bootstrap](https://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/emacs-as-my-leader-vim-survival-guide/)\r\n- [Evil Mode: How I Switched From VIM to Emacs](http://blog.jakubarnold.cz/2014/06/23/evil-mode-how-to-switch-from-vim-to-emacs.html)\r\n\r\n###it's a kind of [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit)\r\n- [Learn you some magit](http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-magit-emacs-mode-git)\r\n- [Magit Cheatsheet](http://daemianmack.com/magit-cheatsheet.html)\r\n- [Meet Magit](http://vimeo.com/2871241)\r\n\r\n### emacs package growth\r\n![](http://tracker.endlessparentheses.com/newPackagePlotEver.png)\r\n\r\nThat is all you need!\r\n\r\n### got emacs?\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unbalancedparentheses/lunfardo/master/images/text_editors.jpg)\r\n\r\n## key bindings\r\nM-SPC reduces the space between words to just one space.
